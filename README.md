I was working on a frontend project with a lot of images, and every time I added a new image, I'd have to upload it to an online image compressor, let it compress (while dealing with upload limits), and then download it back. 

I also had moments where I forgot if I'd already compressed an image, so I'd have to compress everything in the folder just to be sure.

This tool helps me compress on-device, without worrying about privacy (since I'm not uploading anything to anyone's website), doesn't need internet access, and compresses images in place.

Instead of creating a new file like `image_compressed.png`, PhotoLean directly optimizes the original file, maintaining the same filename and location while reducing its file size.
